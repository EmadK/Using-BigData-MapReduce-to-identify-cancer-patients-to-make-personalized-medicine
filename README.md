FASTQ file preprocessing to extract the pure sequence from it â–ª Apply sequence alignment algorithm using biomarkers of disease and define the mutations in the patient sequence( using BigData techniques like MapReduce functions to make alignment between every line"gene" and every biomarker gene to know if the biomarker exist or not, and if it exist will make sure that the patient is cancer patient )

Data preprocessing:
This step is required when a doctor enter the FASTQ file as the next process can't work on the FASTQ format ,so we convert FASTQ format to the format that can be understood by the Hadoop cluster and Hadoop Map Reduce
